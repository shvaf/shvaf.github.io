Hello! My name is Tia and welcome to my GitHub! 

👩‍🔬 I started out in Bioengineering at the University of Maryland, then spent five years in analytical chemistry and drug development at NextCure, an oncology start-up. Along the way, I realized I was more interested in analyzing people than proteins — which led me to a Master’s in Biostatistics.

📊 Since then, I’ve worked on projects ranging from Python NLP for cancer research at the Knight Cancer Institute to EHR data analysis on maternal morbidity. I love turning messy health data into meaningful insights.

💻 These days, I’m freelancing, taking on new clients, and always building out new portfolio projects.

⛰️ Outside of data, you’ll usually find me outside, enjoying the mountains by camping or hiking in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. 

If you want to contact me, my LinkedIn is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stamatiavafeas/) and my email is shvafeas@gmail.com.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
